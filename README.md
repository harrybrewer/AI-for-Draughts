# AI-for-Draughts
Copy of my dissertation including my written dissertation
The project was the create multiple Artificial intelligence algorithms for the game of Draughts
They were then compared against each other to see which is a more effective method

A heuristic search algorithm using a constructed rule base to determine what move to make
An Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm using a generated game tree to evaluate and choose what move to make

In my iterations of these two algorithms within my version of Draughts constructed for this project it was the Heuristic algorithm
